The positions of galaxies can tell us a lot about the Universe and gravity.
Measurements by the [Planck satellite](https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Planck/Planck_and_the_cosmic_microwave_background) provide a precise picture of the temperature on a slice of the Universe
around 13.77 billion years ago.

The temperature variation seen on that slice arises because the amount of energy at each position on the slice varies.
