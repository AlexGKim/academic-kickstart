The positions of galaxies can tell us a lot about the Universe and gravity.
Measurements by the [Planck satellite](https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Planck/Planck_and_the_cosmic_microwave_background) provide a precise picture of the temperature of a slice of the Universe
around 13.77 billion years ago.

The temperature variation seen in the picture arises because of the variation of the
amount of energy in that slice.

The simplest "statistical properties" that are onsidered are the amplitude of the flutuations and
the sizes of the fluctuotions. In picture made by Planck, these correspond to the range
of  temperatures between the blue and red blobs, and the sizes of the blobs. 


Since 13.77 billion years ago and today the energy variations seen in that picture have moved around
due to the force of gravity.  Using General Relativity (the model of gravity that seems to work given
all experimental evidence) or any other theory of gravity, we can calculate (with some uncertainty) how those energy fluctuations
evolve in time.  If we assume that the statistical
properties of that slice of the Universe seen by Planck also apply to the rest of the observalbe Universe,
we can predict the statistical properties of the energy fluctuations of the more nearby Universe.

Regular matter makes up part of the energy seen by Planck (though most of the energy is in the form of
Dark Matter).  So the statistical properties of the distribution of galaxies are expected to be directly related those
of the energy fluecations.

In a nutshell, given the statistcal properties of the temperature variations seen by Planck and a theory of
gravity, we can predict the statistical properties of galaxues.


To calculate the likelihood, we need to determine the probability of there being galaxies at some finite
number of positions while there not being any galaxies at the complementary infinite  set of positions.

$$P(\text{number of galaxies at a finite set of coordinates}) = \frac{P(\text{number of galaxies at a finite set of coordinates}) }{P(\text{zero galaxies})} P(\text{zero galaxies})$$
