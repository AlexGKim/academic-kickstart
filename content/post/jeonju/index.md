In my youth, around 10 years old, I went on a family trip to Jeonju 전주.  The objective, as far as I remember, was food.  Jeonju is known for its food, and its local delicacies include bibimbap 비빔밥 and kongnamul gukbap 콩나물국밥.  I was skeptical about traveling halfway down the country to eat something as ordinary as bibimbap, which can be quickly assembled using the contents of any Korean refrigerator.  It only took one bite to understand why we had made that long trip, there is something special about that food.

For my current visit to Korea, I decided to devote the weekends to exploring the food in regions that I don't get to visit during my regular visits to Seoul.  The first place on my list was Jeonju.  While that long-ago meal left a lasting impression, the specifics of *why* remain hazy.  A revisit with my now adult understanding of my culinary tastes could help formalize my instinctive response.
