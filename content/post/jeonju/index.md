In my youth, around 10 years old, I went on a family trip to Jeonju 전주.  The objective, as far as I remember, was food.  Jeonju is known for its food, and its local delicacies include bibimbap 비빔밥 and kongnamul gukbap 콩나물국밥.  I was skeptical about traveling halfway down the country to eat something as ordinary as bibimbap, which can be quickly assembled using the contents of any Korean refrigerator.
